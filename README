******Musical Colours*********

I created these scripts to create a musical display using the RGB LED light strip in my van.
Details of the circuit used and output examples can be found here:

******************************

BeatListener.pde - Required for minim to run BeatDetect and FFT. Must be in same directory as other files.

MusicalColours.pde - The main script. Used to create a dynamic colour depending on the amplitude of 3 frequency ranges (bass, mid and tre) in the
music

MusicalFlash.pde - Simply uses BeatDetect to flash all the LEDs with the beat.

AudioLED.ino - An Arduino sketch that does not require serial from a computer to vary the brightness of
the LEDs according to the amplitude of an input sound.
